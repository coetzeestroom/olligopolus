So how about the RX5700? Is it good? Is it bad?

Well, it's neither. For you, the important thing is that it's FREE!

The 5700 was first released back in 2019, so it's a good 6 years old now. It's still capable of 'good' 1080p gaming. It's relatively light weight, and is easy on your electricity bill.


## A Benchmark

This is a Fortnight benchmark that compares the RX5700 to a RTX2080. It's a bit rough and ready, and you need to always remember the GOLDEN RULE, but it roughly shows the RX5700 to be just a bit less than the RTX2080.

## Cyberpunk

The Cyberpunk benchmark gives us around 70 fps.

## Fortnight

So I figured out how to switch on the FPS counter, but then didn't actually get it in the frame <img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbTBzOTF1OTZqazhlOXZqa2MzdzlyOHY5OXBzZmw2cm53MHN0Z2Y0eSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/jUwpNzg9IcyrK/giphy.gif" width=50 height=50>:
