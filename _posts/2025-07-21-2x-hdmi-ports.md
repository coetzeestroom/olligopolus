You have 2 hdmi ports on the back of your PC:
1. One at the top - that plugs into the motherboard
2. One about half way down - that plugs into your graphics card.

### Don't use this one:

### Don't use the one at the top. Why?

When you plug into the top port, you will use the graphics card that's built into your motherboard and CPU. For you this is a a reasonably but not amazing Ryzen graphics. It's not as good as the big card that has 4 ports on the back of it.


How do I know this for certain? Well, when I did your unboxing video, I plugged it into the WRONG ONE. I got about 8 FPS in cyberpunk, and if I tried to force the graphics card using settings, the whole system would freeze.

Nightmare fuel:
